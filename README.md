README for Veteran Suicide Prediction Model

Veteran Suicide Prediction Using TensorFlow & Python

This project builds a machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict veteran suicide rates across different states and years based on historical data.

📌 Project Overview

Veteran suicide is a critical issue, and this project aims to analyze trends and make future predictions based on historical data from 2001-2022. Using machine learning techniques, this model takes into account year, geographic region, and state to estimate the number of veteran suicides.

📂 Dataset

The data comes from an Excel file provided by the VA (Veterans Affairs), which contains:
	•	Year (2001-2022)
	•	Geographic Region (Northeastern, Southern, etc.)
	•	State (All 50 U.S. states & territories)
	•	Number of Veteran Suicides

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python 🐍
	•	TensorFlow / Keras 🤖
	•	Scikit-Learn 📊
	•	Pandas 🏷️
	•	Matplotlib 📈

🚀 How to Run This Project

1️⃣ Set Up Environment

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veteran-suicide-prediction.git
cd veteran-suicide-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Train the Model

Run the training script to process the dataset and train the TensorFlow model:

python src/train_model.py

3️⃣ Make Predictions

After training, you can make predictions:

python src/predict.py --year 2025 --state "Texas"

Example Output:

Predicted Veteran Suicides in Texas (2025): 105

📊 Model Performance
	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 232.97 (Avg error in suicide predictions)
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 349,559.59 (Measures overall prediction accuracy)
	•	Training Improvement: Loss decreased over 100 epochs, indicating learning.

🔍 Future Improvements
	•	Add More Features (e.g., GDP, unemployment rates, VA funding per state)
	•	Tune Model Architecture (test more layers, neurons, optimizers)
	•	Deploy Model (build a FastAPI endpoint for real-time predictions)
	•	Integrate a Dashboard (using Streamlit to visualize suicide trends)
